# Top 10 List of Week 08

1. [CPU Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpu-scheduling-in-operating-systems/)<br>
A good article explaining about maximizing CPU through CPU Scheduling. There are a number of objectives in Process Scheduling Algorithm. There are also different types of the said algorithm, with different ups and downs. The article also has a small quiz at the end with answers explained.

2. [CPU and I/O Burst Cycles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVzb3TUcDLo)<br>
A nice video explaining about CPU burst and I/O burst. A process execution consists of a cycle of CPU execution and I/O wait. It alternates between the two. And at the end, there will be one last CPU execution, requesting to terminate the current process. The video also shows an example on this type of process.

3. [CPU Scheduling Criteria](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpu-scheduling-criteria/)<br>
As explained before in the first article, different CPU Scheduling Algorithms have different properties and the choice of particular algorithm depends on various factors. These criterias helps decide which algorithm to choose.

4. [Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/preemptive-and-non-preemptive-scheduling/)<br>
A nice article explaining the differences between Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling in Operating Systems. Preemptive are used when a process wants to change from waiting to ready state. Non-preemptive are used when a process is waiting from running to a waiting state.

5. [Difference between Asymmetric and Symmetric Multiprocessing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-asymmetric-and-symmetric-multiprocessing/)<br>
Multiprocessing is the use of two or more central processing units within a single computer system. Differences are Asymmetric doesn't treat proccessors equally, tasks of the operating system are done by master processor, and process are master-slave. Symmetric treats processors equally, tasks of the operating system are done by individual processor, and the process are taken from the ready queue.

6. [Multiprocessor Scheduling in Operating System](https://www.includehelp.com/operating-systems/multiprocessor-scheduling-in-operating-system.aspx)<br>
An explanation about scheduling done in a multiprocessor system. A multiprocessor system consists of several processors which share memory. In the multiprocessor, there is more than one processor in the system. Since there are more than one processor or CPU, various process can run simultaneously.

7. [Priority Scheduling Algorithm in Operating System](https://www.guru99.com/priority-scheduling-program.html)<br>
A well-written article explaning the Priority Scheduling Algorithm. It uses priority on scheduling all the tasks. Preemptive and Non-Preemptives, both are types of Priority Scheduling. The article also has some examples on priority scheduling to help understand more.

8. [Scheduling Priorities - Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/scheduling-priorities)<br>
This article explains how Windows OS uses scheduling priorities on their system. There are Priority Class, Priority Level, and Base Priority.

9. [When you set a 100% CPU program to real-time priority, you get what you asked for](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20100610-00/?p=13753)<br>
What happens when you set a 100% CPU program to real time priority? The program will use all the CPU's resources, that means it is the highest priority, not even your mouse or keyboard input will override it, and it's almost impossible to read your input in attempt to terminate it.

10. [Completely fair Scheduler (CFS) and Brain Fuck Scheduler (BFS)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/completely-fair-scheduler-cfs-and-brain-fuck-scheduler-bfs/)<br>
An interesting name on Scheduling. These process scheduler are used in Linux. Each scheduler has it's characteristics, with time complexity analysis.
