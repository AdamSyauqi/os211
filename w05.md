# Top 10 List of Week 05

1. [Virtual Memory in Opeating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)<br>
An explanation about Virtual Memory used in Operating System. It explains how a virtual memory can make a main memory seems larger than it actually is. Virtual memory uses some techniques or ways to enable that.

2. [Demand Paging in OS (Operating System): Examples, Advantages, Working](http://digitalthinkerhelp.com/demand-paging-in-os-operating-system-examples-advantages-working/)<br>
Although demand paging already explained a bit in the first link, this article explains about demand paging more and also provides examples.

3. [Virtual Memory 3: What is Virtual Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlH4-oHnBb8&)<br>
A video explanation on Virtual Memory. I find this easier to understand because it has better visualization and it's sometimes easier to understand from someone's voice.

4. [Copy On Write](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/copy-on-write/)<br>
A quick explanation on how Copy On Write works. Suppose there is a process named P that creates a new process called Q, and process P modifies one of the pages, then a new copy of that page will be created and the process P will refer to that newly created page, while process Q will still refer to the old page.

5. [Page Replacement Algorithms in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-systems/)<br>
As mentioned in the first link, when a page fault occurs, operating system needs to replace a page for a new needed pageto be used. There a number of algorithms that can be used.

6. [NUMA (Non Uniform Memory Access)](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/NUMA-non-uniform-memory-access)<br>
NUMA is a method of configuring a cluster of microprocessor in a multiprocessing system so that they can share memory locally, improving performance and the ability of the system to be expanded. More explanation on this method is in this link.

7. [Allocation of Frames in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocation-frames)<br>
Demand paging necessitates the development of a page-replacement algorithm and a frame allocation algorithm. Frame allocation algorithms are used if you have multiple processes; it helps decide how many frames to allocate to each process. This site explains on two Frame Allocation algorithms and also explains the difference between global and local allocation.

8. [Thrashing in Operating System](https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/2019/02/thrashing-in-operating-system-os.html)<br>
When page fault and swapping occurs very frequently at a higher rate, then operating system has to spend more time to swap these pages. This state is called thrashing. Because of this, CPU utilization is going to be reduced. Global and Local page replacements algorithms are not suitable, so how does OS handles it?

9. [Top Command in Linux](https://linuxhint.com/top_-command-_linux/)<br>
In UNIX-like systems, the top command reports valuable system information like running processes and resource usage. It shows processor activity and kernel-managed tasks in real-time. Its one of the staple tools for system administrators.

10. [Buddy and Slab Allocator in Linux](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocating-kernel-memory-buddy-system-slab-system/)<br>
Buddy allocation system is an algorithm in which a larger memory block is divided into small parts to satisfy the request. This algorithm is used to give best fit. The two smaller parts of block are of equal size and called as buddies. In the same manner one of the two buddies will further divide into smaller parts until the request is fulfilled. Benefit of this technique is that the two buddies can combine to form the block of larger size according to the memory request. Slab allocation eliminates fragmentation caused by allocations and deallocations. This method is used to retain allocated memory that contains a data object of a certain type for reuse upon subsequent allocations of objects of the same type. In slab allocation memory chunks suitable to fit data objects of certain type or size are preallocated
