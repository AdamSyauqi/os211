# Top 10 List of Week 09

1. [Backblaze Hard Drive Stats Q1 2020](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/backblaze-hard-drive-stats-q1-2020/)<br>
Take a look at the first quarter of 2020. Backblaze had 132,339 spinning hard drives in their cloud storage ecosystem. In total, annualized failure rate were at 1.07%.

2. [Timeline of Computer History (Memory & Storage)](https://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/memory-storage/)<br>
A nicely designed timeline of the history of computers in memory and storage. Shows all kinds of storage even before the founding of hard disks.

3. [RAID](https://www.prepressure.com/library/technology/raid)<br>
A thorough explanation about the RAID technology. RAID is a technology that is used to increase the performance and/or reliability of data storage.

4. [BIOS](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/BIOS-basic-input-output-system)<br>
A brief explanation about a computer's microprocessor program. This is used to start the computer system after it is powered on.

5. [What Is UEFI, and How Is It Different from BIOS?](https://www.howtogeek.com/56958/htg-explains-how-uefi-will-replace-the-bios/)<br>
Both UEFI and BIOS are low-level software that starts when you boot your PC before booting your operating system, but UEFI is a more modern solution, supporting larger hard drives, faster boot times, more security features, and—conveniently—graphics and mouse cursors. This article explains on how UEFI will replace BIOS in the future

6. [Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/advanced-configuration-and-power-interface)<br>
A thorough explanation on ACPI. I've seen in the VM Virtualbox that there is an ACPI Shutdown option, but I had never truly understood what ACPI means.

7. [What Is a Boot Loader?](https://linuxhint.com/what-is-a-boot-loader/)<br>
In short, a boot loader is a program responsible for loading the Linux kernel with optional kernel parameters and the Linux initial RAM disk, known as initrd. There are a couple of popular Linux boot loaders such as GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader), LILO (Linux Loader), and SYSLINUX.

8. [Difference Between MBR vs GPT: Linux Partitioning Guide For Beginner](https://itsubuntu.com/difference-between-mbr-vs-gpt-linux-partitioning-guide-for-beginner/)<br>
While setting up your hard disk, there will be an option whether you want to use MBR (Master Boot Record) or GPT (GUID Partition Table). The key differences are MBR only supports up to 2TB drives and can hold a maximum number fo 4 entries for primary partitions in the Windows Operating System. GPT supports more than 2TB and up to 128 partitions. To install your system on an GPT disk, you'll need to enable UEFI on your BIOS configuration setting.

9. [Understanding systemd at startup on Linux](https://opensource.com/article/20/5/systemd-startup)<br>
A brief understanding on systemd at startup on Linux. This article explains how to explore Linux startup with your systemd

10. [What is firmware? What does firmware do?](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/simple-questions-what-firmware-what-does-it-do/)<br>
A neat explanation on the word firmware. In short, Firmware is a small piece of software that makes hardware work as its manufacturer intended it to. It consists of programs written by software developers to make hardware devices "tick." Without firmware, most of the electronic devices we use daily wouldn't be able to work. They would not do anything.
