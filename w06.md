# Top 10 List of Week 06

1. [Concurrency in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/concurrency-in-operating-system/)<br>
An article explaning the concept of Concurrency in Operating System. Concurrency is one of the things happening in Operating Systems, what are the problems, advamtages, and drawbacks of Concurrency?
 
2. [Concurrent Processes in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/concurrent-processes-in-operating-system/)<br>
A computing model in which multiple processors execute instructions simultaineously for better performance. There are visualization with explanations on the terms in concurrent processing.

3. [Operating System - Process Scheduling](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling.htm)<br>
Operating Systems schedules multiple processes with statuses like ready, waiting, and running. This allows the Operating System to allocate time intervals to execute every process. This is important to prevent threading issues.

4. [Threading Tutorial #1 - Concurrency, Threading and Parallelism Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olYdb0DdGtM)<br>
A video explanation about three things, Concurrency, Threading, and Parallelism. Great for people who's reading alone doesn't explain enough.

5. [Inter Process Communication](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inter-process-communication-ipc/)<br>
Two processes can communicate with each other through two different methods. Shared memory uses the Producer and Consumer Problem, The producer produces some items and the Consumer consumes that item. Message Passing uses a communication link where modules can send or recieve messages.

6. [Multithreading Models in Operating System](https://binaryterms.com/multithreading-models-in-operating-system.html)<br>
Multithreading is a way to process data into multiple threads to increase speed. There are three models, Many to One, One to One, and Many to Many.

7. [fork() in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fork-system-call/)<br>
In short, Fork system call is used to create a new process, which is called a child process that runs concurrently with the parent process. The article also includes some explanation with codes and some graphs.

8. [Mengenal RPC (Remote Procedure Call)](https://medium.com/programmer-geek/mengenal-rpc-remote-procedure-call-7d8a794bbd1f)<br>
At first, I didn't really understand about RPC but here I found one article, and it's in Bahasa. I'm still don't understand that well, but this article helps me a bit.

9. [Concurrency vs. Parallelism - A brief view](https://medium.com/@itIsMadhavan/concurrency-vs-parallelism-a-brief-review-b337c8dac350)<br>
In short, Concurrency defines how to "handle" multiple things at one time, while Parallelism defines how to do "multiple" things at one time. An application can be either parallel or concurrent, but not both.

10. [Introduction to Threads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOfGJcVnvAk)<br>
Thread is the smallest unit in a process in an operating system. The video clearly explains about threading.
